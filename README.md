# Discrete Math

### Textbook and submissions from my high school Discrete Math class

#### All submissions were completed in latex. Submissions 1.1 to 2.2 were done from the Logic Textbook pdf (included lessons and questions from a variety of sources) and Munkres 1.1 to 1.3 was completed from the Munkres Topology Textbook

- Submission 1.1: Truth-Functional Logic Pt 1 (Informal Proof, Conditional Proof, and Proof by Contradiction, Truth Tables)
- Submission 1.2: Truth-Functional Logic Pt 2 (Formal Proof, Truth Tables, and Natural Deduction)
- Submission 2.1: Quantificational Logic Pt 1 (Interpretation to and from English)
- Submission 2.2: Quantificational Logic Pt 2 (Natural Deduction, Validity, Soundness, Informal Proof, and Proof by Contradiction)
- Munkres 1.1: Set Theory Pt 1 (Power Set, Arbitrary Unions and Intersections, Cartesian Products, Contrapositive and Converse)
- Munkres 1.2: Set Theory Pt 2 (Functions: Surjective, Injective, Bijective; Inverses: left, right; Proofs)
- Munkres 1.3: Set Theory Pt 3 (Equivalence relations and classes; Reflexivity, symmetry, and transivity properties; Partitions; Order relations)
